# Clip Studio Paint (CSP) 3D Reference Guide 

For CSP compatibility in v1, export a **posed OBJ snapshot** (no rig). 
## Steps 
1. Pose character in app. 
2. Export OBJ snapshot. 
3. Import OBJ into CSP as 3D reference. 
## Important 
- CSP workflow here is for posed reference meshes, not full skeletal animation transfer.
